**üö® Problem Statement**

1. **Market Access Uncertainty:**
Farmers often struggle to find reliable buyers for their produce, leading to inconsistent income and excess supply that may go unsold or at low prices.
2. **Fluctuating Incomes:**
Due to unpredictable market prices, farmers' incomes are highly volatile, which impacts their financial stability and ability to plan for future harvests.
3. **Limited Access to Secure Contracts:**
Farmers face difficulties in establishing formal contracts that protect their interests and ensure fair pricing, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation.
4. **Uncertainty in Timely Payments:**
Delayed or non-payment for produce is a common issue, further increasing financial instability for farmers.
5. **Lack of Negotiation Power:**
Individual farmers, especially smallholders, have limited bargaining power when dealing with large buyers, resulting in lower-than-market prices for their crops.
6. **High Risk in Agricultural Production:**
Without guaranteed buyers or agreements in place, farmers face the risk of market price fluctuations after the harvest, leading to potential losses.
